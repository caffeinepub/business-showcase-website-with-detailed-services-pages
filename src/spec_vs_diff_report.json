  "summary": "REQ-19 appears implemented by updating the centralized tagline in siteContent.ts; however REQ-20 is not implemented because no uploaded logo asset was added and there is no diff evidence that the header <img> was switched to use IMG_4371-5.PNG-derived square logo across environments.",

      "id": "REQ-20",
      "requirement": "Use the user-uploaded image IMG_4371-5.PNG as the site logo and ensure the header logo renders reliably across environments without falling back to the text-based placeholder.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no new static asset added for the uploaded logo (Added: 0 files). There is also no code diff for SiteHeader to confirm the header <img> was updated to use the uploaded image-derived asset and to avoid triggering the onError fallback in normal operation.",
